## Ambient sounds ðŸ§˜

I created this project to try building something simple with vanila javascript since I mostly use frameworks and libraries both at work and private. This one I wrote using only javascript, html and scss.

Features:
- Plays background video with a "playlist" of sounds corresponding to the current category.
- Different resolution video files are loaded based on the viewport size.
- If no video file is available, a colored background is shown instead.
- Easy to add/edit/remove categories, videos and sounds via cards.js.

All sounds and videos are royalty free!
